Hi! My name is Thiago Rocha. I'm 31 years old and I'm living in [Stockholm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm). I was born in Brazil and I have no interest in soccer, beaches and many other things related to our culture. I consider myself a rare kind of brazilian :P

I currently work as an Android developer for [P.F.C](https://getpfc.com/). Besides this I also do "crazy" open-source code for [CodeLogic](http://codelogic.me/); I enjoy practicing serious (and fun) table tennis and I enjoy experimenting sounds with my electric guitar.

I've graduated in Computer Science at [PUC Minas](http://www.pucminas.br/) in 2012 and my favorite topics are **Image Processing**, **Software Architecture** and **Compilers**. I find myself in love when I craft mobile systems (I've been doing it since 2011).

If you'd like to contact me for any reason don't hesitate to drop me a line at [kimo@kimo.io](mailto:kimo@kimo.io) or use the [contact]({{site.base_url}}/contact) page. You can also find me in the social medias linked in the footer of this website.
