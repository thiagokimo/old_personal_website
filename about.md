Hi! My name is Thiago Rocha. I'm 28 years old and I'm living in [Nova Lima](https://www.google.com/search?q=Nova%20Lima%20brazil&rct=j). I was born in Brazil and I have no interest in soccer, beaches and many other things related to our culture. I consider myself a rare kind of brazilian :P

I currently work as an Android developer for [Lalubema](http://lalubema.com/), a small startup in [Belo Horizonte](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=belo%20horizonte). Beside this I also do "crazy" open-source code for [CodeLogic](http://codelogic.me/); I'm a former table tennis player of [Minas Gerais](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=minas%20gerais)' state and I enjoy experimenting sounds with my electric guitar.

I've graduated in Computer Science at [PUC Minas](http://www.pucminas.br/) in 2012 and my favorite topics are **Image Processing**, **Software Architecture** and **Compilers**. I find myself in love when I craft mobile systems (I've been doing it since 2011).

In the future I have plans to leave my country, joining a great team, facing more difficult challenges and so on :)

If you'd like to contact me for any reason don't hesitate to drop me a line at [kimo@kimo.io](mailto:kimo@kimo.io) or use the [contact]({{site.base_url}}/contact) page. You can also find me in the social medias linked in the footer of this website.
