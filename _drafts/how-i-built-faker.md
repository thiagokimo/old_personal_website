summary: How a simple detail turned into code

Faker is an Android library that I've built to provide me fake data, so that I could use in my Android views. It was inspired from the libraries with the name in other languages, like this [ruby library](https://github.com/stympy/faker). The idea is pretty straight forward and I won't give details about it. I'll tell you instead tell my motivations behind it, my reasons of building this library and what did I learn with the process.

In 2015 I decided to find a job in Scandinavia. In one of my weekly job hunts I found a danish company offering a job that made my eyes shine. After reading the job description and its requirements I couldn't believe...I was really confident that I could fit the position. YaY! I applied right away and it was the night of May 2nd.

By the morning of May the 8th I received this email from a recruiter:

<blockquote>
  <p>Dear Thiago,</p>

  <p>Thank you again for your application.  I was hoping that I can give you a call sometime within the next couple of days. The purpose of the call is for me to get a better idea of your profile and to give you a chance to ask questions about the position and <b>The Company</b> in general.</p>

  <p>Kind regards,</p>

Yes! They selected me! I couldn't believe it only took a week. I've scheduled a Skype call with the recruiter few days later. I was very excited with that opportunity and I was focused to make everything perfect...and it was.

The call with the recruiter was fine. We talked about me, my professional goals, my motivations to work in their company and all of that usual HR talking. He liked me and I passed the initial phase. The next interview were going to be done by one of their mobile teams. A more technical talk was coming and I was very happy with that. In the following week (May 13th to be exact) the recruiter said my next interview were going to happening on the 20th with the mobile developers team.

Alright!
