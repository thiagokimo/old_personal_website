summary: How am I organizing my Android code
categories:
---

Since November of 2014 I've been reading and experimenting some clean architecture approaches of Android code. After trying couple of those approaches I finally decided to implement my own version of it. The initial goal was the creation of interfaces and abstract java classes that would rely my future projects on. Those "helpers" classes would be inside a dependency so I could simply import them into any projects I would work from now. The name of the dependency is nothing original: **Base**. I called it that way because I'm used to prefix my abstract classes with the word *Base* (e.g *BaseActivity*, *BaseFragment*, *BaseWhatever*, etc).

The code is available [here](https://github.com/thiagokimo/base).

## Architecture

### Presentation
The view logic resides here. The **Model-View-Presenter** pattern was used to keep all the presentation logic into presenters and away from the fragments and activities (which were considered only views).

#### Views
One of the links between **Base** and the Android framework is inside the *BaseView* class, which connects views with Android Fragments. The views are dumb, meaning that they don't know how to process any data at all.

#### Presenters
The presenters are the connection between the *presentation* layer and the *domain* layer. It calls use-cases that are performed in
background, outside the UI Thread, and returning what was processed through a callback.

#### Models
Nothing fancy. Just regular POJOs.

### Domain
This layer might have all of you business rules.

#### UseCases
The *BaseUseCase* implements the java *Runnable*, which were made to be processed in the background by any kind of *Executor*,  responding the results in the UI Thread, which forced me to have a connection of this class with the Android framework because of *Looper.getMainLooper()* of Android (shame on me).

#### Mappers
The *BaseMapper* is a class that I use to transform data, mostly Entities into Models. No big deal here.

#### Entities
POJO classes.

## Features
The idea is adding common features that I identify in the projects as generic use cases, views or presenters.

### Load Data Collection
A very simple thing that I'm use to do is to create a view that shows loading state while I collect a list of data from somewhere, showing the results later on in a list. This feature is available through *LoadDataCollectionView*, *LoadDataCollectionPresenter* and *LoadCollectionUseCase*.

## Coming soon
- The very first "trending" thing I'll do is creating a **RxPresenter**. It will react to any subscribed UseCases from the domain layer.
- The maintainance of the views according to the fragments/activities lifecycle.

## Conclusion
**Base** is not a framework, it's a library. You don't need to follow the exact architectured described in this post if you don't want to. You can import its modules separately as you prefer and used them with your own pattern. Is important saying that as the time passes, things evolve. I'll do my best to contanstly evolve this code (and it will be better if you help me out).

Cheers!
